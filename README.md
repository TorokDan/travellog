# Travel Log App
The goal is to create an application that allows users to share photos and details about their vacation. Users should be able to browse other usersâ€™ experiences and search stories and posts by location.

## Backend
- REST API for the needed entities
- Auth with JWT
- DB
- Store images on the filesystem
- Ability to subscribe to a user, so that when they upload, you get an email with the new link (emailing + scheduled tasks)
